# Grass

Grass is a plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in a lawn and other places. Grass gets water from the roots in the ground. Grass is usually pigmented with the colour ‘green’. Grasses are monocotyledon, herbaceous plants.



The grasses include the "grass", of the family Poaceae (also called Gramineae). Also sometimes it is used to include the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae). These three families are not closely related but belong to different clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a common life-style.



The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.



Many grasses are short, but some grasses, like bamboo can grow very tall. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places, even if they are very cold or very dry. Several other plants that look similar but are not members of the grass family are also sometimes called grass; these include rushes, reeds, papyrus, and water chestnut.



Grasses are an important food for many animals, like deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows. Without grass, dirt can wash away into rivers (erosion).

Graminoids include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous. Fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found containing grass phytoliths (silica stones inside grass leaves).[Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are now the most widespread plant type. Grass is a valuable source of food and energy for many animals.Lawn grass is often planted on sports fields and in the area around a building. Sometimes chemicals and water is used to help lawns to grow.



People have used grasses for a long time. People eat parts of grasses. Corn, wheat, barley, oats, rice and millet are cereals, common grains whose seeds are used for food and to make alcohol such as beer.



Sugar comes from sugar cane, which is also a plant in the grass family. People have grown grasses as food for farm animals for about 4,000 years. People use bamboo to build houses, fences, furniture and other things. Grass plants can also be used as fuel, to cover roofs, and to weave baskets. 

n English, the word "grass" appears in several phrases. For example:



"The grass is always greener on the other side" means "people are never happy with what they have and want something else."

"Don't let the grass grow under your feet" means "Do something".

"A snake in the grass" is about a person that will not be honest and will trick others.

Grass is sometimes used as a slang term for cannabis (also called pot, weed, or marijuana)
The Grass type (Japanese: くさタイプ Grass type) is one of the eighteen types. Prior to changes in Generation IV, all damaging Grass-type moves were special, but they may now also be physical depending on the attack. Grass-type Pokémon are immune to Leech Seed. Grass-type Pokémon are immune to Leech Seed 
Starting in Generation VI, Grass-type Pokémon are immune to powder and spore moves and Effect Spore.Grass types are tied with Rock in having the most weaknesses out of all types with five.



Since Generation I, a particular asset of Grass types is being the only type that is immune to Leech Seed. As of Generation VI, Grass-type Pokémon are also immune to powder and spore moves, such as Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. Additionally, Grass Pokémon are the only ones affected by Rototiller and Flower Shield. Those moves raise both attack stats or the physical Defense stat, respectively, when used.



Forest's Curse adds the Grass type to the target's types. Grass-type attacks are resisted by seven types, so they're tied with Bug as the most resisted type. Those resistant types are best covered by Rock and Ground. As of Generation VI, Dark and Ghost have neutral matchups against every type that resists Grass.



When Grassy Terrain is in the effect, the power of Grass-type moves is increased by 30% (50% prior to Generation VIII) if the user is on the ground.



Contest properties In contests, Grass-type moves are typically Clever moves, but can also be any of the other four contest conditions. As of Generation VIII, there are 112 Grass-type Pokémon or 12.27% of all Pokémon (counting those that are Grass-type in at least one of their forms), making it the third most common type after Normal and before Flying. A Pokémon with Protean or Libero will become a Grass-type Pokémon if it uses a Grass-type move. A Pokémon with Color Change, Imposter, Mimicry, RKS System, or Multitype will become a Grass-type Pokémon if (respectively) it is hit with a Grass-type move, is sent out against a Grass-type opponent, if the terrain is grassy, if it is holding a Grass Memory, or if it is holding a Meadow Plate or Grassium Z.



Since Generation VI, Grass-type Pokémon are also immune to Effect Spore.Only Grass-type Pokémon can have these Abilities. This does not include signature Abilities.Due to the decreased amount of types in the TCG, Grass generally adopts all Bug-type Pokémon under its typing. It also adopted Poison-type Pokémon prior to the Diamond & Pearl set, after which they were moved to Psychic.



Similar to the games, Grass-type Pokémon in the TCG are generally weak to Fire and resist Water. Grass-type Pokémon are strong against Fighting and Water Pokémon, whilst Metal Pokémon resisted it until the EX Power Keepers expansion set.
Generation V introduced the most Grass-type Pokémon of any generation, with 21 (including Rotom's Mow form), and Generation VI introduced the fewest Grass-type Pokémon, with nine.

Generation I introduced the most Grass-type moves of any generation, with 10, and Generation II introduced the fewest Grass-type moves, with three.

The Grass type and/or Pokémon of the type have been referred to using the term "plant" instead on some occasions:

In the English Generation I games, the Gym guide in Cerulean Gym refers to Pokémon of the Grass type as "plant Pokémon". In the English versions of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, he instead mentions "Grass-type Pokémon". In the Japanese versions of the Generation I games and FireRed and LeafGreen, he mentions the Grass type itself, calling it the "Plant type" (Japanese: しょくぶつタイプ).

Another reference to "plant Pokémon" (Japanese: しょくぶつポケモン) is made by Professor Oak in the Japanese Pokémon Red, Green, and Blue, and international Pokémon Red and Blue, classifying Bulbasaur as such when the player is about to choose it as their starter. This is also the case in the Japanese versions of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen; in contrast, he calls it the "grass Pokémon" in the English versions.

This same reference is also used in the first episode of Pokémon Origins.

In multiple languages, such as French and German, the Grass type is translated as the Plant type.

The Turkish dub of the anime occasionally refers to "Grass type" as "Plant type".

The Grass type has the most Pokémon that evolve by Evolution stones, with a total of 11. It is also the type that can utilize the most stones, having at least one Pokémon that can evolve via the Leaf Stone, Sun Stone, Water Stone, and Shiny Stone.

The Grass type is the only type to have more than one HP-draining move, having five of them.

Grass-type attacks deal doubly super-effective damage to the most Pokémon of all types.

Grass-type attacks are super effective against the three types that Fire types are weak to.

Fire is the only type that hasn't been paired with Grass.

In Tree's a Crowd, Brock states that Grass-type Pokémon resist Electric-type moves due to being able to diffuse the electricity into trees and the ground. He also explains that if Grass types are in the air, they cannot diffuse the electricity from Electric attacks, thereby dealing normally effective damage.
